## THIS IS A POWER BI DASHBOARD OF A LARGE DATASET FLIGHTS.CSV FILE. I HAVE IMPORTED A CEV EXCEL FILE INTO IT TO MAKE A INTERACTIVE DASHBOARD WITH MEANINGFUL INSIGHTS. IT'S A GREAT WAY TO SHOW INSIGHTS ABOUT THE DATA THROUGH VISUALS AND GRAPHS AND DIAGRAMS. IT'S A PICTORIAL REPRESENTATION OF SHOWING STATISTICS ABOUT THE DATASET. I HAVE APPLIED MANY ACTIONS AND VISUALS INTO THIS TO MAKE IT MORE CLEAR AND UNDERSTANDABLE ABOUT THE BACKGROUND INSIGHTS ABOUT DATASET. IT ENHANCES THE OVERALL APPEARANCE OF RAW DATASETINTO A GOOD LOOKING DASHBOARD WITH IT'S FEATURES. WE CAN CUSTOMIZE THE DASBOARD AS PER THE REQUIREMENTS WITH IT'S SUPPORTED EFFECTS AND FORMATS AND MODELLING. NOW THIS DASHBOARD GIVES INSIGHTS ABOUT THE FLIGHT ANALYSIS. THE AVERAGE DEPARTURE, COUNT OF ORIGIN, TOTAL CUSTOMERS WITH PIE CHART REPRESENTATION AND BAR GRAPH PLOTS.##
